    abstract = { Many civilizations have risen and then collapsed. There can be many causes. A major influence can be how Elite (wealthy or ruling) populations interact with the Commoners (workers) and with the environment. Each population's size can fluctuate. We say a model is “Elite-dominated" when the Elites' per capita population change rate is always at least as large as the Commoners'. First we present a class of ordinary differential equation models in which the Commoner population \$C(t)\$ as a function of time \$t\$ always crashes (i.e., \$C(t)\to 0\$ as \$t\to\infty\$), sometimes only after undergoing many oscillations. Our main tool is a new Lyapunov function theorem. Next, we discard the equations entirely, replacing them with qualitative conditions, and we prove these conditions imply population collapse must occur. }

    abstract = { Abstract. The extinction of species is a major problem of concern with a large literature. We investigate a differential equations model for population interactions with the goal of determining when several species (i.e., coordinates of a bounded solution) must die out or “go extinct” and must do so exponentially fast. Typically each coordinate represents the population density of a different species. For our main tool, we create what we call “die-out” Lyapunov functions. A given system may have several or many such functions, each of which is a function of a different set of coordinates. That die-out function implies that one of the species in its subset must die out exponentially fast—for almost every choice of coefficients of the system. We create a “team” of die-out functions that work together to show that \(k\) species must die, where \(k\) is determined separately. Second, we present a “trophic” condition for generalized Lotka–Volterra systems that guarantees that there is a trapping region that is globally attracting. That implies that all solutions are bounded. }
