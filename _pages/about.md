Naghmeh Akavan is a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). Her research focuses on mathematical physiology, specifically modeling the behavior of cell migration in the egg chamber of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) using mathematical and biophysical methods. In addition to her work on cell migration, she also models animal infectious diseases, including West Nile Virus in birds and heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) in dogs and cats.
